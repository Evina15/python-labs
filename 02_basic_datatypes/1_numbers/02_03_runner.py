'''

If a runner runs 10 miles in 30 minutes and 30 seconds,
What is his/her average speed in kilometers per hour? (Tip: 1 mile = 1.6 km)

'''

 = 10  # runner runs 10 miles
km = runs*1.6  # converting miles to km
hour = 30.5/60  # converting minutes to hour

km_per_hour = km/hour # calculate average speed
print(km_per_hour)
